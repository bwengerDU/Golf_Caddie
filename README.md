## Purpose

This program is meant to provide myself with continually evolving analysis of my golf game. I only recently began golfing and I hope to use data analytics to assist in my development as a player. 

I will develop an interface to allow me to instantly access my historical hitting distances and performances to assist me strategize which clubs to use in given situations on a golf course. I also want to use running data to identify opportunities in my golf game that would lead to lower scores. 

## Home Golf Course 

I am currently playing at Greenway Par 3 Golf Course as my home course and this will serve as my benchmark for progress. Although I will play at other locations, I will use this course as the barometer of progress. 

I will have several key factors for analysis that will be highlighted:
- Average number of approach shots: This will examine how effective I am at getting onto the green from the Tee Box. An ideal Par 3 score is to reach    the green with 1 shot. 
- Average number of putt shots: This will capture how efficient I am in getting the ball into the hole. An ideal Par 3 score is to have only 2 putt shots. 

### Together these two scores should result in a score of 3 per hole. You cannot have less than one for an approach shot so you ideally want to keep the average below 2 with a score of 1 being the best possible. Ideal putting scores for a par 3 is 2 shots. Putting is often the key component of the game in which a player can either play conservatively and aim for two shots to secure Par scoring and aggressive play in which 1 or 3+ putts can result. It must also be said that higher scores are as likely to result from lack of skill as well.

-I am examining Average distances hit with each club. These averages are going to change over time and may require adjustment to weight recency more highly as I improve my striking abilities the distances are going to increase. The goal of this is to examine what distances can be expected from a full swing of each type of club. This analysis is aimed at providing me a guide to deciding on which club to use when I am in a given position on the golf course. This program will incorporate data from every time I use a full swing with a club and will continually be updated to reflect my striking ability. Chip shots and adjusted shots will not be counted in the data, but rather I will know the full swing capacity of a shot and make adjustments to those swings to suit a given situation when needed.
